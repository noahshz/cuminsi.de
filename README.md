work in progress

## ToDo's:

-> rework structure to model view controller pattern (classes.php => models, logic.php =>controllers, sites = view)
-> create class user as model (all functions like: createUser, getUser etc.)
-> create class post as model (all functions like: createPost, editPost, LikePost)
